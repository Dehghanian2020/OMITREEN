# OMITREEN (Omics Training and Research Network)
High-throughput cell biology is used to address biological questions that are otherwise unfeasible using conventional methods. High-throughput data generated in different fields including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics have opened a new era in drug discovery and are relevant to the fields of biology and chemistry. Here, in the Omics Training and Research Network (OMITREEN) we are trying to study the complexity of cellular life using computational biology (especially in the field of omics) and experimental methods. We are interested in making a collaborative environment to do the research and make it easy for others by introducing interactive training workshops. This group has been honored to collaborate with the University of Isfahan, Freiburg Galaxy Europe, and Carpentries. We welcome your valuable research ideas and collaborations.
